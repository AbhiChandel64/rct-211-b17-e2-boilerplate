#### Boiler plate code for RCT-211-B17.E2

#### Pending:
- [ ] Instead of directly reading from db.json, use `npm run server` and use [http://localhost:8080](http://localhot:8080) to get shoes
- [ ] Move filters to actions
- [ ] Redirect to previous page while login - can redirect like - http://localhost:3000/login?redirectUrl={currentPageUrl}, and on successfull login redirect user to `currentPageUrl`
- [ ] Find a way to persist auth state, can use localStorage or redix-persist
